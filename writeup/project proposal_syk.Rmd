## Introduction

|    I am interested in studying the career processes of entrepreneurs, especially those who move in and out of traditional, hierarchical firms. Kacperczyk and Younkin (2021) found that having an entrepreneurial experience negatively influences workers' prospects at the hiring stage and shows how this founding penalty varies by gender. Study 1 is a resume-based audit study that tested the effect of entrepreneurial experience on the probability of interview callbacks, and Study 2 is an experimental survey that attempted to evaluate the explanations about why there exists a penalty for ex-founders returning to wage employment. I replicate the findings from Study 2, because it is not only appropriate in scope and time but also engages with the literature on understanding why founding penalties exist.

|    Participants are asked to evaluate a given job candidate's qualities, especially fit and commitment, and are assigned to one of four conditions: female founder, male founder, female non-founder/employee, and male employee. This survey experiment therefore is a two-by-two between-subject design, where primary manipulations are gender and entrepreneurial experience. The dependent variable is the respondents' willingness to recommend the given job candidate to a future employer, and mediating variables are the extent to which the given job candidate is a good fit to a hierarchical organization and is likely to quit next job. To control for the respondents' characteristics, at the end of the experiment, the respondents' information including their age, gender, and years of work experience will be collected.  

|    I do want to add additional questions to the experiment that were not included in the original study.  Right after the participants make evaluations about a given job candidate, I would like for them to list all reasons why they would or would not want to recommend this person to a future employer. This is because asking them specifically about fit and commitment like in the original study would yield only limited insights into how the employers make decisions in that we lose information on other dimensions used when evaluating candidates, such as capability and failure bias. 

|    The primary challenge will be to find a sample as similar as possible to the original study: marketing managers with more than five years of work experience and at least a bachelor's degree who come from a diverse range of industries, including manufacturing, advertising, healthcare, software development, and consulting. I am especially worried about the industry composition of the marketing managers, because this might be strongly correlated with their perceptions about ex-founders and hence change the study result. Another challenge will be challenges associated with attention retention that especially stem from my additional questions. The more questions and tasks respondents are asked to do, the more likely that the responses we get are answered with lack of attention / carefulness.
